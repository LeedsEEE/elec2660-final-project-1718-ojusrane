//  In this view controller I have variable declarations, properties, actions and methods which can run 3 stopwatches in my app at the same time. Please note, I am commenting on one set of stopwatch code and not the other two sets because they will be duplicates of the one I am commenting on. Only the declared names will change on the two I'm not commenting on.

    NSTimer *StopwatchOne;
        // NSTimer is a built-in class used in my app to run code in repeated loops to whatever time interval I set it too. For every loop, it fires a specific message to the target object we set it too. In this case, I would like my time interval to be one millisecond, and target object to be "updateStopwatchOne" method. So it will perform the "updateStopwatchOne" method every one millisecond.
    int CountStopwatchOne;
        // I have declared an integer called "CountStopwatchOne" as this will play a part in updating the Stopwatch label in the Storyboard.
    BOOL RunningStopwatchOne;
